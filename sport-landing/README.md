## 🖼️ Design Concept

The website blends **vibrant greens** with **dark contrast backgrounds** to evoke energy, motion, and a sense of renewal — reflecting the mission of _Running For Change_.  
Each section flows like a “stride”: from the motivational hero header to the mission-driven footer, maintaining thematic cohesion and readability.
